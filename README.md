The necessity for comprehensive animal rescue and welfare services remains critical, as millions of animals suffer from neglect, abuse, and abandonment each year. Existing platforms often fail to integrate comprehensive user engagement, seamless donation processes, transparency, and broader community and environmental activities. This project aims to address these gaps by creating a multifaceted platform that not only supports animal rescue operations but also integrates environmental sustainability efforts and community involvement.![image](https://github.com/Rowzatul-2001/planetPaw/assets/122299855/a068f19b-7fb8-4c34-9e9b-128be4383f41)
